Ever wondered if those ginormous source code files could slow down your program? In Programming 101, it's pretty basic knowledge that scripting languages would feel the hit, while compiled languages would be chill about it. But hey, let's put it to the test, shall we?

## Experiment 1: Python

So, in Python land, the bigger the file, the longer it takes to execute. No surprises there!

## Experiment 2: Go

Now, let's hop over to the world of Go, where things are compiled and snazzy. Guess what? The same principle holds true here too. File size still plays a role in execution time.

## Experiment 3: Python vs. Go Smackdown

Hold onto your seats for this one! When we pit Python against Go, it's like witnessing a sloth racing against a cheetah. Python struggles to keep up with the lightning-fast speed of Go. It's a knockout victory for Go, my friends!

Take it as a friendly reminder that when it comes to programming, code organization and file size do matter. Optimize your code, embrace the power of compiled languages, and let the speed demons like Go show you the way.
